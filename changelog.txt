Avionics System v2.0

Changes made:
1. Fixed includes:
	-removed unnecessary includes and moved them to the implementation file
	-removed redundant/duplicate includes

2. Project filesystem structure
	-separated tasks into the folder /tasks
	-separated sensor tasks into the folder /tasks/sensors
	-removed unused files
	-added new files resulted from separating and categorizing some functions
	and putting them aside into different files

3. Naming
	-names for many files (most of the files)
	-e.g: dataLoging -> flight_state_controller, xtract -> command_line_interface, etc...


4. Name conventions:
	-typedefs, structs, enums, unions: made a step towards standardising the naming across the project

5. Design
	-redesigned flash.h/flash.c dataLoging.h/dataLoging.c
	-built a state machine in the dataLogger to enable flexible control of the state changes

6. Documentation
	-provided some template on how headers may look like (see flash.h and flash.c)
